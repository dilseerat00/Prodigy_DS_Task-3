# PRODIGY_DS_03-Intern-Jupyter-Lab-TASK-03

## Project Overview

The objective of this task was to build a decision tree classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their demographic and behavioral data.

## Task Details

- **Task:** Build a decision tree classifier.
- **Dataset:** Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
- **Tools Used:** Jupyter Lab, Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn.

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Collection:** 
   - The Bank Marketing dataset was obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

2. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Handled missing values.
   - Categorical variables were encoded using techniques such as One-Hot Encoding.
   - Split the data into training and testing sets.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Visualized the distribution of features and the relationship between them.
   - Analyzed patterns and trends that might influence the target variable.

4. **Model Building:**
   - Constructed a decision tree classifier using Scikit-learn.
   - Tuned hyperparameters to improve model performance.

5. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Evaluated the model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
   - Visualized the decision tree for better interpretability.

## Conclusion

This task provided hands-on experience in building and evaluating a decision tree classifier, enhancing my understanding of predictive modeling and its applications in marketing analytics.
